<h2>In this project, I guide you through setting up Splunk on an Ubuntu machine and administering the platform. We'll delve into key concepts such as Splunk's architecture, understanding logs, and specifically, how to interpret logs generated by a firewall. Join me on this journey into effective Splunk usage!  <br />


<h2>Tools used
<br />
<br />
- <b>Ubuntu VM <br />
- <b>Splunk access <br />

1. Initial Steps:
   Created admin account with username and password for secure access. This step is crucial for secure access to our Splunk instance.

2.  Generated a username and password as prompted by Splunk. This admin account ensures privileged access to our Splunk environment.

3. Web Interface Request:
<br />
Splunk generated a request on a web interface at 127.0.0.1:8080.
This is our entry point to the Splunk world and voila! we have a GUI interface where we can directly do some administration in.
